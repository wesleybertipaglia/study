## What Can You Do with JavaScript?

-   **Web**: JavaScript is primarily used for client-side web development. You can use it to enhance the functionality and interactivity of web pages by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), handling events, creating animations, and making asynchronous requests to servers.

-   **Server-side**: With platforms like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development. You can build web servers, APIs, and backend services using JavaScript, allowing for full-stack development using a single language.

-   **Mobile**: JavaScript frameworks like React Native and Ionic allow you to build cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript. These frameworks enable you to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms.

-   **Desktop**: Frameworks like Electron enable you to build desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). You can create desktop apps for Windows, macOS, and Linux using familiar web development tools and workflows.

-   **Game**: JavaScript can be used for game development using libraries and frameworks like Phaser, Three.js, and Babylon.js. You can create 2D and 3D games for web browsers and mobile platforms using these tools.

-   **Data Visualization**: JavaScript libraries like D3.js and Chart.js allow you to create interactive data visualizations and charts for web applications. You can display complex data in a visually appealing way and enable users to explore and interact with it.

-   **Web APIs**: JavaScript can interact with various web APIs to access data and services from external sources. You can integrate features like maps, geolocation, weather information, social media, and more into your web applications using JavaScript.

-   **Browser Extensions**: JavaScript can be used to develop browser extensions/add-ons for popular web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. You can extend the functionality of web browsers and customize the browsing experience for users.

-   **Internet of Things (IoT)**: JavaScript can be used for IoT development with platforms like Johnny-Five and Espruino. You can build applications that interact with connected devices, sensors, and actuators using JavaScript.

-   **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**: JavaScript libraries like TensorFlow.js and Brain.js allow you to build and train machine learning models directly in the browser or on Node.js servers.
