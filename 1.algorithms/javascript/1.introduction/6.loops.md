# Loops

Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.

## For

The for statement defines a code block that is executed as long as a condition is true.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

## While

The while statement creates a loop (around a code block) that is executed while a condition is true.

The loop runs while the condition is true. Otherwise it stops.

```js
let i = 0
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i)
  i++
}
```

## Do While

The do...while statements combo defines a code block to be executed once, and repeated as long as a condition is true.

The do...while is used when you want to run a code block at least one time.

```js
let i = 0
do {
  console.log(i)
  i++
} while (i < 5)
```

## Break and Continue

**BreaK:** the break statement breaks out of a switch or a loop.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
  if (i === 5) {
    break // Exit the loop when i reaches 5
  }
}
```

**Continue:** breaks one iteration (in the loop) if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

```js
let i = 0
while (i < 5) {
  i++
  if (i === 3) {
    continue // Skip the current iteration when i is 3
  }
  console.log(i)
}
```

## Foreach

Iterate over the elements of an array and execute a function for each element.

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.forEach((number, index) {
  if (number % 2 == 0) {
    return; // Skip the current iteration when the number is even
  }
  console.log(number);
});
```

## For...in

The for...in statements combo iterates (loops) over the properties of an object.

The code block inside the loop is executed once for each property.

```js
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }

for (let key in obj) {
  console.log(key + ': ' + obj[key])
}
```

## For...of

The for...of statements combo iterates (loops) over the values of any iterable.

The code block inside the loop is executed once for each value.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3]

for (let value of arr) {
  console.log(value)
}
```
