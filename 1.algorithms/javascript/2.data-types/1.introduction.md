# Data Types

JavaScript supports several data types that are used to represent different kinds of values. Here are the primary data types in JavaScript.

## Primitive Data Types

#### Numbers

Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

```js
let age = 30
let pi = 3.14
```

#### String

Represents textual data enclosed within single or double quotes.

```js
let name = 'John'
let message = 'Hello, World!'
```

#### Boolean

Represents logical values true or false.

```js
let isStudent = true
let isLoggedIn = false
```

#### Undefined

Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

```js
let x
```

#### Null

Represents the intentional absence of any value.

```js
let y = null
```

## Complex Data Types

#### Object

Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be of any data type, including other objects.

```js
let person = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,
    isStudent: false,
}
```

#### Array

Represents an ordered list of values, where each value is indexed by a numeric position.

```js
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
```
