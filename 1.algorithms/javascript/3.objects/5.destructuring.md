# Object Destructuring

Object destructuring is a feature that allows you to extract multiple properties from an object and assign them to variables in a more concise and readable way. It's particularly useful when working with objects returned from functions or APIs, where you need only a subset of the object's properties.

```js
let person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 30,
}

let { firstName, lastName, age } = person
```

## Nested Destructuring

```js
let student = {
  name: 'Alice',
  info: {
    grade: 'A',
    age: 25,
  },
}

let {
  name,
  info: { grade, age },
} = student
```

## Renaming Variables

You can also rename variables during destructuring:

```js
let { firstName: fName, lastName: lName } = person
```

## Default Values

```js
let { firstName, lastName, gender = 'Unknown' } = person
```

## Rest

You can use the rest syntax (...) to collect remaining properties into a new object:

```js
let { firstName, ...rest } = person
```

## Destructuring Function Parameters

Object destructuring is commonly used with function parameters:

```js
function printInfo({ firstName, lastName, age }) {
  console.log(`Name: ${firstName} ${lastName}, Age: ${age}`)
}

printInfo(person)
```
