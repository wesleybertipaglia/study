# Class

In JavaScript, the class keyword is used to define a new class, which serves as a blueprint for creating objects with similar properties and methods. It's a syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance.

Here's how you can use the class keyword to define a class:

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age, id) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.#id = id; // private property
  }

  getId() {
    return this.#id;
  }

  greet() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
}
```

## Create an object of a class

```js
let person1 = new Person("John", 30, "34523465432");
```
