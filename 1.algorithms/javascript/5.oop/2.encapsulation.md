# Encapsulation

Refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, often called a class.

```js
function Car(make, model) {
  var make = make
  var model = model

  this.getMake = function () {
    return make
  }

  this.getModel = function () {
    return model
  }

  this.setModel = function (newModel) {
    model = newModel
  }
}
```

## Purposes

- **Data Hiding:** Encapsulation hides the internal state (data) of an object from the outside world. This means that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside, and access to it is restricted to certain methods or functions within the class. This prevents the direct modification of internal data, which helps maintain the integrity of the data and prevents accidental misuse.

- **Abstraction:** Encapsulation also provides abstraction, which means that the implementation details are hidden and only the essential features of an object are exposed to the outside. This allows the user of the object to interact with it using a well-defined interface without needing to know the internal complexities of its implementation. Abstraction allows for easier maintenance, as changes to the internal implementation can be made without affecting the external code that uses the object.
