# Inheritance

You can also create subclasses (derived classes) that inherit from a parent class using the extends keyword:

```js
// Superclass
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }

  speak() {
    return this.name + ' makes a sound'
  }
}

// Subclass
class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name) // Call superclass constructor
    this.breed = breed
  }

  speak() {
    return super.speak() + ', and it is a ' + this.breed
  }
}

// Creating instances
let animal = new Animal('Animal')
let dog = new Dog('Buddy', 'Golden Retriever')

console.log(animal.speak()) // Output: Animal makes a sound
console.log(dog.speak()) // Output: Buddy makes a sound, and it is a Golden Retriever
```

## Super Constructor

- When a subclass is created, it automatically calls the constructor of its superclass using the super() method.

- This initializes inherited properties and performs any setup defined in the superclass constructor.

## Overriding Methods

- Subclasses can override methods inherited from the superclass by defining a method with the same name.

- This allows subclasses to provide their own implementation of inherited methods.

## Accessing Superclass Methods

- Inside a subclass, you can access methods from the superclass using the super keyword.

- This is useful when you want to call the superclass method from within the subclass method, or when you want to access properties or methods defined in the superclass.
