# Polymorphism

Polymorphism in JavaScript refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same message or method invocation in different ways.

```js
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name
    }

    makeSound() {
        return 'Animal makes a sound'
    }
}
class Lion extends Animal {
    makeSound() {
        return 'Roar!'
    }
}

class Tiger extends Animal {
    makeSound() {
        return 'Growl!'
    }
}

class Elephant extends Animal {
    makeSound() {
        return 'Trumpet!'
    }
}
```

## How Polymorphism Works

-   Despite being different types of animals, they all share a common method makeSound().

-   When we call makeSound() on an animal object, JavaScript automatically figures out which version of makeSound() to use based on the actual type of the object.

-   This ability of objects to behave differently based on their actual type is what we call polymorphism.
