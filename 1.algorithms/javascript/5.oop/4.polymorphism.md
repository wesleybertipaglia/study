# Polymorphism

Polymorphism in JavaScript refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same message or method invocation in different ways.

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }

  makeSound() {
    return 'Animal makes a sound'
  }
}
class Lion extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    return 'Roar!'
  }
}

class Tiger extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    return 'Growl!'
  }
}

class Elephant extends Animal {
  makeSound() {
    return 'Trumpet!'
  }
}
```

## How Polymorphism Works

- Despite being different types of animals, they all share a common method makeSound().

- When we call makeSound() on an animal object, JavaScript automatically figures out which version of makeSound() to use based on the actual type of the object.

- This ability of objects to behave differently based on their actual type is what we call polymorphism.
