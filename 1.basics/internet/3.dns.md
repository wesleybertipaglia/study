# DNS (Domain Name System)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses and vice versa.

DNS simplifies internet communication by allowing users to use domain names (e.g., www.example.com) instead of remembering numerical IP addresses.

## Components

- Domain Names: Human-readable labels used to identify resources on the internet (e.g., example.com).

- IP Addresses: Numerical addresses assigned to devices on the internet (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

- DNS Servers: Servers that store DNS records and respond to queries.
