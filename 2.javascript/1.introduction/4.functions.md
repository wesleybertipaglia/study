# Functions

You can define functions using the function keyword.

## Regular function

Function declarations define a named function. They consist of the function keyword followed by the function name and a block of code.

```js
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("Alice"); // call the function
```

## Arrow function

Arrow functions are a concise syntax for writing function expressions. They are especially useful for anonymous functions and functions with short bodies.

```js
var add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

add(10, 20);
```

## Function Expressions

Function expressions define a function as part of an expression. They can be named or anonymous.

Named Function Expression:

```js
const multiply = function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
};
```

Anonymous Function Expression:

```js
const divide = function (a, b) {
  return a / b;
};
```

## Immediately Invoked Function Expressions

An IIFE is a function that is executed immediately after it's created. It's typically wrapped in parentheses to indicate that it's a function expression, followed by an additional pair of parentheses to invoke it.

```js
(function () {
  console.log("This is an IIFE");
})();
```

## Callback Functions

Callback functions are functions passed as arguments to other functions, which are then invoked inside the outer function.

```js
function fetchData(callback) {
  // Asynchronous operation
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = { name: "John", age: 30 };
    callback(data);
  }, 1000);
}

function processData(data) {
  console.log(data);
}

fetchData(processData);
```
