# Code Formatters

Code formatters automatically reformat source code to adhere to a specific coding style or set of rules, improving consistency and readability.

### Features

- Standardize code indentation, spacing, and line breaks.
- Align code elements according to predefined rules.
- Normalize code formatting across a codebase, making it easier to read and maintain.

### Integration

Code formatters are often integrated into development workflows similarly to linters, either through IDE extensions, build systems, or pre-commit hooks in version control systems.

### Popular JavaScript Code Formatters

- **Prettier**: A highly configurable code formatter that supports various programming languages, including JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It enforces a consistent code style and can be integrated into various editors and build tools.

- **JS Beautifier**: A simple code beautifier for JavaScript that focuses on indentation and formatting. It's not as feature-rich or configurable as Prettier but provides basic formatting capabilities.

- **TSLint (for TypeScript)**: Though primarily a linter, TSLint can also enforce code formatting rules specific to TypeScript projects.
