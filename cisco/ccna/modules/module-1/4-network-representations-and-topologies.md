# Network Representations and Topologies

## Topologies
### Physical Topologies
- **Bus Topology:** All devices share a single communication line.
- **Ring Topology:** Devices are connected in a circular fashion.
- **Star Topology:** All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
- **Mesh Topology:** Devices are interconnected, providing redundancy and multiplepaths.
- **Tree Topology:** Combination of star and bus topologies, forming a hierarchy.

### Logical Topologies
- **Ethernet Logical Bus Topology:** Devices share a logical communication path in Ethernet networks.
- **Token Ring Logical Topology:** Devices access the network by passing a token in a logical ring.

## Representations
### Physical topology diagrams
Physical topology diagrams illustrate the physical location of intermediate devices and cable installation, as shown in the figure. You can see that the rooms in which these devices are located are labeled in this physical topology.

### Logical topology diagrams
Logical topology diagrams illustrate devices, ports, and the network addressing scheme, as shown in the figure. You can see which end devices are connected to which intermediate devices and what media is being used.
