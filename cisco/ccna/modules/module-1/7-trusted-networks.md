# Trusted Networks

## Fault Tolerance
- **Redundancy:**
  - Incorporating backup components or systems to ensure continued operation in case of failures.
- **Load Balancing:**
  - Distributing network traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload and enhance fault tolerance.
- **Failover Mechanisms:**
  - Automatic switching to backup systems or components in case of a failure.

## Scalability
- **Vertical Scaling:**
  - Increasing the capacity of individual network devices or components.
- **Horizontal Scaling:**
  - Adding more devices or nodes to a network to handle increased load.
- **Distributed Architecture:**
  - Designing the network to distribute workloads across multiple nodes or locations.

## Quality of Service (QoS)
- **Traffic Prioritization:**
  - Assigning priority levels to different types of network traffic.
- **Bandwidth Management:**
  - Controlling and optimizing the allocation of bandwidth to ensure QoS.
- **Packet Scheduling:**
  - Determining the order in which data packets are transmitted to enhance QoS.

## Security
- **Firewalls:**
  - Implementing barriers to filter and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):**
  - Monitoring and responding to malicious activities within the network.
- **Encryption:**
  - Securing data by converting it into a coded format that can only be deciphered with the right key.
- **Access Control:**
  - Restricting and managing user access to network resources based on permissions.
- **Authentication Protocols:**
  - Verifying the identity of users or devices before granting access to the network.
- **Security Audits and Monitoring:**
  - Regularly reviewing and analyzing network activities for potential security threats.
