# Network Security

## Firewalls
- **Packet Filtering:**
  - Examining data packets and allowing or blocking them based on predefined rules.
- **Proxy Firewalls:**
  - Acting as intermediaries between users and the internet to enhance security.

## Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)
- **Signature-Based Detection:**
  - Identifying known patterns of malicious activity.
- **Behavioral-Based Detection:**
  - Analyzing deviations from normal network behavior.

## Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- **Encryption Protocols:**
  - Implementing secure encryption for data transmitted over the network.
- **Tunneling Protocols:**
  - Creating secure pathways for data to travel through the internet.

## Access Control
- **Authentication:**
  - Verifying the identity of users or devices before granting access.
- **Authorization:**
  - Defining and managing the level of access granted to authenticated users.

## Security Audits and Monitoring
- **Log Analysis:**
  - Regularly reviewing logs to identify and respond to security events.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:**
  - Constantly monitoring network activities for signs of potential threats.

## Endpoint Security
- **Antivirus Software:**
  - Detecting and removing malicious software on individual devices.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):**
  - Monitoring and responding to security incidents on endpoints.

## Wireless Security
- **WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3):**
  - Enhancing Wi-Fi security with stronger encryption and protection against brute-force attacks.
- **Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems (WIPS):**
  - Detecting and preventing unauthorized access to wireless networks.

## Security Policies and Procedures
- **Policy Development:**
  - Establishing guidelines and rules for network security.
- **Employee Training:**
  - Educating users about security best practices and policies.

## DDoS Mitigation
- **Traffic Filtering:**
  - Identifying and blocking malicious traffic during a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
- **Anycast Technology:**
  - Distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers to mitigate DDoS impact.

## Cloud Security
- **Data Encryption:**
  - Ensuring data confidentiality in cloud environments.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**
  - Managing and securing access to cloud resources.

## Threat Intelligence
- **Information Sharing:**
  - Collaborating with external sources to stay informed about emerging threats.
- **Proactive Security Measures:**
  - Using threat intelligence to implement preemptive security measures.
