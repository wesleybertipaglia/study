# Descriptive Analytics
Focuses on understanding and summarizing historical data to gain insights and identify patterns, trends, and anomalies. It involves using various statistical and visualization techniques to describe and present the characteristics of a dataset. Descriptive analytics provides a foundational understanding of the data and serves as a starting point for more advanced analytical processes. Here are key aspects of descriptive analytics:

### Data Summary
Descriptive analytics involves generating summary statistics to describe the central tendency, dispersion, and distribution of data. Common summary statistics include mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and percentiles.

### Data Visualization
Visual representations, such as bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps, are used to visually communicate data patterns and trends. Visualization helps make complex data more accessible and understandable.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves using visualizations and statistical techniques to explore the data for initial insights. It helps identify outliers, patterns, correlations, and potential areas of interest.

### Frequency Analysis
Descriptive analytics can include frequency analysis to determine the occurrence and distribution of categorical variables or values within a dataset.

### Time Series Analysis
Time-based data is often analyzed using time series techniques to uncover patterns and trends over time, which can aid in forecasting future behavior.

### Data Profiling
Data profiling involves examining the data to understand its structure, quality, completeness, and potential issues. This step is essential for ensuring data quality and reliability.

### Segmentation
Segmentation involves dividing data into meaningful groups based on certain attributes. For example, customer segmentation groups customers with similar behaviors or characteristics.

### Dashboards and Reports
Dashboards and reports provide a consolidated view of descriptive analytics results, making it easier for decision-makers to understand and interpret data insights.

### Root Cause Analysis
Descriptive analytics can help identify potential causes for certain patterns or events by examining the data in detail.

### Comparative Analysis
Comparing different subsets of data or groups can reveal differences, similarities, and relationships that offer valuable insights.
